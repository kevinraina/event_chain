## Introduction

EventChain is designed to address common issues in traditional ticketing systems, such as counterfeit tickets, ticket scalping, and lack of transparency. By utilizing NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, EventChain provides a decentralized, secure, and verifiable way to manage tickets for various events including concerts, theater, and cinema.

## Features

- **Secure Ticketing**: Each ticket is minted as an NFT, ensuring uniqueness and preventing counterfeiting.
- **Transparent Ownership**: Track the ownership history of each ticket on the blockchain.
- **Expiration Control**: Set expiration dates for tickets to ensure they can only be used within a valid timeframe.
- **Event Management**: Organizers can create events and manage ticket issuance through the EventManager contract.
- **Resale Control**: Set maximum resale prices to prevent ticket scalping and protect consumers.
- **Auditable Events**: Emit events for actions like minting, transferring, validating, and burning tickets to enable full transparency.

## Smart Contracts

### EventManager Contract

The `EventManager` contract is responsible for creating and managing events. It interacts with the `NftTickets` contract to mint tickets for specific events.

#### Key Functions

- **createEvent**: Create a new event with details such as name, location, date, and ticket price.
- **getEventDetails**: Retrieve details of a specific event.
- **mintTicket**: Mint a new ticket for a specified event.

### NftTickets Contract

The `NftTickets` contract is an ERC721 compliant contract that handles the minting, transferring, validating, and burning of tickets.

#### Key Functions

- **safeMint**: Mint a new ticket with details such as event information, original price, and expiration date.
- **validateTicket**: Mark a ticket as used, ensuring it cannot be reused.
- **getTicketHistory**: Retrieve the ownership history of a ticket.
- **getTicketStatus**: Check if a ticket is used and if it is still valid.
- **updateTicketMetadata**: Update the metadata of a ticket.
- **setMaxResalePrice**: Set a maximum resale price for a ticket.
- **burnExpiredTickets**: Burn tickets that have expired to free up resources.
